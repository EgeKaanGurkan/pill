# Pill
As an early start to my CS315 course, I wanted to see if I can implement my own basic programming language. It is written in Python.
The language is called "Pill".

## Progress

The lexer, parser and the interpreter are done.

## TODO

Variables!

**Note:** I am directly following [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZQftyCk7_SdoVexSmwy_tBgs7P0b97yD) tutorial series which is about implementing a version of BASIC.
